    <h1> Euclid's Algorithm </h1>

    <body>
        <p> In mathematics, because 8 divides 24 evenly, we say that 8 is a
            <b>divisor</b> of 24. When computing, it is often useful to find the
            largest divisor that two numbers have in common. For example, 36
            and 24 are both divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 12: the greatest
            divisor that they have in common is 12. It turns out that finding
            common divisors for numbers is critical for modern cryptography,
            including public-key crypto systems such as RSA: a backbone of internet
            commerce. 
        </p>
        <p> Perhaps the oldest algorithm known -- ever! -- is for computing the
            greatest common divisor of two positive numbers. It is attributed to the
            Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BCE. Here's how it goes: 
        </p>

        <p> You are computing the greatest common divisor ("gcd") of two positive
            integers called "a" and "b". The gcd can be computed recursively (or
            iteratively) using the following three rules: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> gcd(a,b) = a                    if a == b </li>
            <li> gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b)           if a > b  </li>
            <li> gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a)           if a < b  </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Write a JavaScript (_not_ Python) program that declares a function called gcd
            that accepts two positive integer arguments a and b and returns their greatest
            common divisor.
        </p>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            function gcd(a,b) {
                if (a == b)
                    return a;
                else if (a > b)
                    return gcd(a-b, b);
                else
                return gcd(a, b-a);
            }
            
            document.write( gcd(24,8) == 8 ); 
            document.write(" ");
            document.write( gcd(1362, 1407) ); // Empress Xu (Ming Dynasty) wrote biographies
            document.write(" ");
            document.write( gcd(1875, 1907) ); // Qiu Jin, feminist, revolutionary, and writer
            document.write(" ");
            document.write( gcd(45,116) ); // Ban Zhao, first known female Chinese historian
